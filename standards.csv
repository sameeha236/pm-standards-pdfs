1. Guiding Principles & Concepts,PMBOK 7,53,"PMBOK 7 adopts a principles-based approach. It defines 12 guiding principles (e.g. stewardship, collaboration, stakeholder engagement, focus on value) that shape project management behaviors. These principles are broad, non-prescriptive guidelines intended to steer decision-making and outcomes, emphasizing value and alignment with ethics rather than enforcing rigid rules."
1. Guiding Principles & Concepts,PRINCE2,39,"PRINCE2 is built on seven mandatory principles (continued business justification, learning from experience, defined roles, manage by stages, manage by exception, focus on products, tailor to project). These principles must be applied in every project to preserve the method’s integrity. They offer flexibility in applying PRINCE2’s themes and processes to each project context while ensuring the method remains consistent."
1. Guiding Principles & Concepts,ISO 21500,13,"ISO 21500 does not list “principles” like PMBOK or PRINCE2 but outlines core concepts guiding project management. It emphasizes strategic alignment to organizational objectives, continuous business justification, stakeholder engagement, clear roles, proportionate governance, and continuous improvement. These concepts are intended to shape the mindset for project governance and management rather than prescribe detailed processes."
1. Guiding Principles & Concepts,ISO 21502,12,"ISO 21502 provides a practice-based framework for project management. It structures its guidance around integrated project management practices (e.g., directing, controlling, closing) and subject-specific practices (e.g., scope, risk, stakeholders). While it does not formally label them as ""principles,"" its philosophy is embedded in foundational concepts such as the integration of practices into a cohesive system, the critical impact of a project's context, and the need to balance interrelated constraints. These concepts emphasize that project management is a tailored, systemic endeavor focused on achieving objectives and delivering value within a specific organizational and environmental context, providing a flexible foundation rather than a prescriptive process model."
2. Tailoring,PMBOK 7,221,"PMBOK 7 places strong emphasis on tailoring. It defines tailoring as the deliberate adaptation of the project management approach, governance, and processes to fit the project’s unique environment. Teams are encouraged to apply “just enough” process, adjusting development approaches, levels of oversight, and tools to the project context. Tailoring is seen as necessary for every project to maximize value and efficiency."
2. Tailoring,PRINCE2,48,"In PRINCE2 the principle “Tailor to suit the project” makes customization mandatory. PRINCE2 is applied and tailored for each project’s size, complexity, and context. The project manager (with board approval) adjusts terminology, processes, documentation and controls (e.g. reporting frequency, roles) so the method fits the project while retaining the method’s core governance. Effective tailoring is required for a “fit-for-purpose” approach."
2. Tailoring,ISO 21500,13,"ISO 21500 advises that project management should be proportionate to the project and tailored accordingly. It explicitly states that “ways of working should be tailored to maximize the likelihood of success”. In practice, this means the governance framework, processes and plans are scaled to suit the project’s scope, complexity, and risk rather than applying a one-size-fits-all approach."
2. Tailoring,ISO 21502,26,"ISO 21502 states that the project management approach should be tailored and applied considering the organization’s needs, prevailing risk, and project-specific considerations. "
3. Governance & Oversight Structure,PMBOK 7,43,"PMBOK addresses Organizational Governance Systems. Governance systems establish a framework with functions and processes that guide activities. This framework is designed to work alongside the value delivery system to enable smooth workflows, manage issues, and support decision making."
3. Governance & Oversight Structure,PRINCE2,93,"In the PRINCE2, the Organizing Practice defines and establishes the project’s structure of accountability and responsibilities (the ‘who’). This structure must clearly define roles, responsibilities, and relationships that effectively engage the three principal categories of project stakeholders: the business, the user, and the supplier. These three interests are brought together on the Project Board, which holds the overall accountability for the success of the project"
3. Governance & Oversight Structure,ISO 21500,13,"ISO 21500 highlights Integrated governance and management approaches. Governance is defined as necessary for authorizing, directing, empowering, overseeing, and limiting the management of projects, programmes, and portfolios"
3. Governance & Oversight Structure,ISO 21502,17,"ISO 21502 specifically addresses Project governance in Section 4.3. Project governance encompasses the principles, policies, and frameworks used by an organization to direct, authorize, and control the project based on an agreed business case.
Project governance should be an integrated part of the sponsoring organization’s overall governance framework"
"4. Roles, Accountability, & Team Management",PMBOK 7,109,"The standard emphasizes the development of the Team Performance Domain, which addresses activities related to the people delivering the project. This is guided by Principle 3.2: to Create a Collaborative Project Team Environment. The goal of this domain is to establish the culture and environment necessary to enable diverse individuals to evolve into a high-performing project team. While leadership activities should be practiced by all project team members, management activities may be centralized or distributed; in centralized environments, accountability (being answerable for an outcome) is typically assigned to a single individual, such as the project manager."
"4. Roles, Accountability, & Team Management",PRINCE2,43,"The People element (Chapter 3) is considered central to the method. The purpose of the Organizing Practice (6) is to define and establish the project’s structure of accountability and responsibilities (the ‘who’). This is reinforced by Principle 2.3: Define roles, responsibilities, and relationships, which mandates that this organizational structure must engage the three principal categories of project stakeholders: the business, user, and supplier communities. This structure should ensure that roles have the necessary authority, responsibility, and knowledge to make decisions in a timely manner"
"4. Roles, Accountability, & Team Management",ISO 21500,7,"While ISO 21500 focuses on overall governance and context, it establishes the foundation for accountability by defining the governing body (3.5) as the entity accountable for the governance of an organization. Governance (4.6) itself is necessary for authorizing, directing, empowering, overseeing, and limiting the management of projects. This function inherently requires the definition of organizational roles and the allocation of responsibilities necessary to carry out this direction and oversight."
"4. Roles, Accountability, & Team Management",ISO 21502,18,"This standard defines the Project organization and roles (4.5) as a temporary structure that specifies clear reporting lines and defines roles, responsibilities, and authorities in the project. Key roles include the Project Sponsor (4.5.4), who is responsible for obtaining the resources and executive decisions to enable success, and the Project Manager (4.5.6). Additionally, the standard addresses the Competencies of project personnel (4.6), noting that the project organization should ensure project personnel possess the necessary capabilities."
5. Stakeholder Engagement & Communication,PMBOK 7,158,"PMBOK 7 highlights stakeholder engagement as a performance domain. It defines stakeholders broadly and stresses proactively identifying, analyzing, and engaging them from start to finish. It advocates two-way communication and relationship-building so that stakeholders’ interests and concerns are understood and addressed, increasing the likelihood of project success."
5. Stakeholder Engagement & Communication,PRINCE2,55,"PRINCE2 formalizes stakeholder involvement in governance. It defines three primary stakeholder interests (Business, User, Supplier) and ensures each is represented (e.g., on the project board). PRINCE2 also requires a Communication Management Approach that specifies how and when stakeholders will be informed and consulted, ensuring stakeholders remain aligned with project objectives."
5. Stakeholder Engagement & Communication,ISO 21500,11,"ISO 21500 defines a Stakeholder (3.18) as any person, group or organization that has interests in, or can affect, be affected by, or perceive itself to be affected by, any aspect of the project. Furthermore, adopting an integrated governance and management approach (4.6) is crucial for facilitating communication"
5. Stakeholder Engagement & Communication,ISO 21502,48,"This standard details the specific management practices required to manage stakeholder relationships and communication throughout the project lifecycle. Stakeholder engagement (7.12) is a specific management practice aimed at enabling the needs, interests and concerns of stakeholders to be identified, understood and addressed sufficiently to enable the objectives to be met. This process involves identifying stakeholders and their interests (7.12.2) and conducting planned engagement activities (7.12.3). Communication management (7.13) covers planning communication (7.13.2) and monitoring the impact of communications (7.13.4), confirming that stakeholder interactions are effective and contribute to project success."
6. Quality Management,PMBOK 7,79,"Principle 3.8 is Build Quality into Processes and Deliverables. The Delivery Performance Domain (2.6) focuses on meeting quality expectations, using metrics and acceptance criteria based on requirements"
6. Quality Management,PRINCE2,147,The Quality Practice (8) documents user requirements and establishes the means by which they will be met. The practice ensures that products meet the user’s quality expectations and acceptance criteria
6. Quality Management,ISO 21500,13,Quality is a guiding concept: work should be appropriately planned and quality should be actively managed
6. Quality Management,ISO 21502,45,"Quality management (7.11) increases the likelihood that outputs are fit for purpose or use. Includes planning, assuring (7.11.3), and controlling quality (7.11.4)"
7. Lessons Learned / Continuous Improvement,PMBOK 7,170,Learning throughout the Project (2.5.8) occurs via lessons learned meetings (retrospectives). The Measurement Domain (2.7) includes Growing and Improving (2.7.6). Diagnostics (3.6) like retrospectives determine if improvements can be made by tailoring
7. Lessons Learned / Continuous Improvement,PRINCE2,41,"Principle 2.2: Learn from experience mandates actively seeking, recording, and implementing lessons throughout the project. The Progress Practice (11) facilitates this. A Lessons report (A.8) shares lessons to embed them in the organization's way of working"
7. Lessons Learned / Continuous Improvement,ISO 21500,14,Continuous improvement is a guiding concept: experience and lessons learned should be captured and used to promote future project performance improvement
7. Lessons Learned / Continuous Improvement,ISO 21502,52,Lessons learned (7.18) is a management practice to benefit from experience and disseminate improved practices. Prerequisite: Continuous improvement of the project management environment (5.3)
"8. Benefits, Value, & Business Justification",PMBOK 7,64,Principle 3.4 is Focus on Value (3.4). Value is the ultimate success indicator. Projects deliver outcomes that ultimately deliver value
"8. Benefits, Value, & Business Justification",PRINCE2,75,"The Business Case Practice (5) assesses whether the project is (and remains) desirable, viable, and achievable. Principle 2.1: Ensure continued business justification"
"8. Benefits, Value, & Business Justification",ISO 21500,7,Defines business case and benefits as key kerms in project management
"8. Benefits, Value, & Business Justification",ISO 21502,17,"The Business Case (4.3.2) is the ongoing documented justification. Benefit management (7.3) is a core practice for identifying, analyzing, monitoring, and maintaining benefits"
9. Planning & Scheduling,PMBOK 7,144,The Planning Performance Domain (2.4) proactively develops the approach to create deliverables. Planning is continuously performed and adapts to the chosen delivery approach
9. Planning & Scheduling,PRINCE2,117,"The Plans Practice (7) defines the products to be delivered (the ‘what’) and the means to deliver them (the ‘when’, ‘how much’, etc.). Manage by stages (2.5) addresses the need to keep plans within reasonable planning horizons"
9. Planning & Scheduling,ISO 21500,13,ISO 21500 emphasizes appropriate planning and management. 
9. Planning & Scheduling,ISO 21502,40,"Planning (7.2) is a management practice defining requirements, scope, resources, and how objectives should be achieved. Schedule management (7.6) develops and controls the timelin"
10. Risk & Uncertainty Management,PMBOK 7,208,"The Uncertainty Performance Domain (2.8) addresses all forms of uncertainty (risk, ambiguity, complexity). Principle 3.10 is to Optimize Risk Responses"
10. Risk & Uncertainty Management,PRINCE2,167,"The Risk Practice (9) aims to identify, assess, and control uncertainties that would affect the project’s objectives"
10. Risk & Uncertainty Management,ISO 21500,9,"ISO 21500 defines uncertainty in strategic terms, distinguishing between positive and negative eventualities. A threat (3.19) is a risk occurrence that would have a negative impact, while an opportunity (3.6) is a risk occurrence that would have a favourable impact. When identifying potential projects and programmes (4.5), factors to be considered include the acceptable level of risk and risk exposure."
10. Risk & Uncertainty Management,ISO 21502,42,"Risk management (7.8) is a core practice covering identifying, assessing, and treating threats and opportunities"
11. Change Control & Issues Management,PMBOK 7,159,Project teams use a change control system where all changes are evaluated for potential value and resource impact. The Issue Log (4.6.2) is a key artifact for tracking and managing issues.
11. Change Control & Issues Management,PRINCE2,187,The Issues Practice (10) aims to collect and assess issues and control changes to the project’s baseline. Issues include request for change and off-specification. The Change control procedure (10.4) describes how changes will be requested and decided
11. Change Control & Issues Management,ISO 21500,13,"Governance provides an integrated structure for evaluating changes, issues, and risks"
11. Change Control & Issues Management,ISO 21502,43,Issues management (7.9) seeks to resolve events requiring action. Change control (7.10) requires establishing a framework (7.10.2) and managing change requests
12. Scope Definition & Control,PMBOK 7,176,"Scope definition is an essential part of the Delivery Performance Domain (2.6), which focuses on generating deliverables and meeting quality expectations. Scope is the sum of the products, services, and results to be provided by the project. Scope can be elaborated using a scope statement or by decomposing it into lower levels using a work breakdown structure (WBS). Scope management is critical to avoid Scope Creep, which is the uncontrolled expansion of scope without corresponding adjustments to time, cost, and resources"
12. Scope Definition & Control,PRINCE2,118,"Scope is formally defined by the approved plan, its product descriptions, and work package descriptions. PRINCE2 mandates focusing on products to clearly define scope (the 'what'). The Plans Practice (7) uses a Product Breakdown Structure (PBS) to elaborate scope into detailed requirements. A clear understanding of what is and what is not within the approved scope is essential to avoid uncontrolled changes"
12. Scope Definition & Control,ISO 21500,8,"The standard addresses the project output (3.7), which is a deliverable produced by a project [3.3, 220]. Successful project management requires clear documentation and management of these outputs, which collectively define the scope."
12. Scope Definition & Control,ISO 21502,37,"Scope management (7.4) is a core practice used to ensure that the project includes all the work required, and only the work required, to achieve its objectives. Defining the scope should clarify what the project is planned to contribute to the objectives of the sponsoring organization. Controlling the scope involves comparing the current status to the approved baseline to manage deviations and scope change request"
13. Cost/Budget Management,PMBOK 7,156,"Cost is tracked as a competing constraint. The Planning Performance Domain (2.4) involves budget preparation (2.4.2.3) and detailed cost estimation, including estimating the Cost of people and resources. The Measurement Performance Domain (2.7) ensures project performance, including schedule and budget performance, is measured against an approved baseline. Earned Value Analysis (EVA) is a method used to determine cost performance."
13. Cost/Budget Management,PRINCE2,134,"Planning requires Preparing the budget (7.3.2.8), which typically includes the costs of activities, the risk budget, and the change budget. The Progress Practice (11.2.2) establishes Cost tolerance to define the degree of permissible overspend or underspend against an agreed budget before escalation is necessary. Forecasting ensures the project remains within the agreed financial limits."
13. Cost/Budget Management,ISO 21500,13,"Governance requires that management approaches combine governance with management to provide guidelines, frameworks, processes, and tools for activities such as cost control. Project work is justified based on financial criteria"
13. Cost/Budget Management,ISO 21502,41,"Cost management (7.7) is a core practice focusing on Estimating cost (7.7.2), Developing the budget (7.7.3), and Controlling costs (7.7.4). Cost estimates should be established for the first phase and the entire project, and may include reserves or contingency funds to deal with uncertainties."
14. Procurement & Contract Management,PMBOK 7,284,The Project Work Performance Domain (2.5) includes Working with Procurements (2.5.6). Project teams typically work with contracting officers due to organizational policies and procedures associated with procurements. Procurement activities may range from utilizing a basic ordering agreement to managing and integrating several large procurement activities. Agreements and Contracts (4.6.8) are recognized as formal project artifacts
14. Procurement & Contract Management,PRINCE2,137,"The Commercial management approach (6.4.3) defines how commercial agreements required for the project will be secured, serviced, and maintained. This includes activities such as market engagement, procurement, and contract management. Plans need to include procurement-related milestones such as purchase orders and milestone payments."
14. Procurement & Contract Management,ISO 21500,13," Integrated governance and management approaches are necessary to manage the context and concepts related to projects, which often includes third-party suppliers and contractual arrangements."
14. Procurement & Contract Management,ISO 21502,51,"Procurement (7.17) is a management practice where the purpose is to source products and services that are of appropriate quality and represent value for money. Procurement management should be integrated with planning (7.2) and must follow organizational procurement processes. The practice involves Planning procurement (7.17.2), Evaluating and selecting suppliers (7.17.3), Administering contracts (7.17.4), and Closing contracts (7.17.5)."
15. Information & Documentation Management,PMBOK 7,276,"Project management relies heavily on Artifacts (Section 4.6), which include documents, templates, outputs, and deliverables. Information distribution should provide for adequate levels of confidentiality, security, and accuracy. The final change in the PMBOK® Guide emphasizes PMIstandards+™, an interactive digital platform, suggesting a move toward dynamic and controlled digital content management."
15. Information & Documentation Management,PRINCE2,223,"The Digital and data management approach (11.5) describes what tools or systems will be used and how information integrity and availability will be maintained, including security requirements. The Project Log (A.13) maintains a dynamic record of continually changing records, including issues, lessons, products, quality, and risk. Project closure involves ensuring all project information is secured and archived."
15. Information & Documentation Management,ISO 21500,13,"Effective governance should contribute to transparency, implying the need for reliable information and documentation systems."
15. Information & Documentation Management,ISO 21502,51,"Information and documentation management (7.16) is a practice that ensures necessary information is identified and managed according to confidentiality, security, and accuracy requirements. A system should be defined and established for receiving, identifying, securely storing and maintaining information and documentation, including business continuity measures."
16. Project Execution / Work Management,PMBOK 7,162,"This standard defines the Project Work Performance Domain (2.5) which focuses on establishing the processes and performing the work to enable the project team to deliver the expected deliverables and outcomes. Execution activities include Working with Procurements (2.5.6), managing physical resources (2.5.5) like materials and supplies, and using efficient methods such as Lean production methods (2.5.1) to measure and remove waste from production systems."
16. Project Execution / Work Management,PRINCE2,271,"Project execution involves allocating and controlling the work packages (WPs). The Managing Product Delivery process (Chapter 17) ensures that work allocated to the team is authorized, agreed upon, delivered to quality expectations, and executed within tolerances. The Project Manager executes overall day-to-day control during Controlling a stage (Chapter 16), ensuring work starts and continues with their consent."
16. Project Execution / Work Management,ISO 21500,-,-
16. Project Execution / Work Management,ISO 21502,30, Project execution is implicitly covered in core integrated practices like Managing delivery (6.7) and Controlling project work (4.3.5). The practice of Managing project performance (6.6.3) requires the project manager to monitor and verify the performance of the project team in undertaking the work assigned to them in the project plan to meet requirements and manage cost/schedule.
17. Performance Measurement & Reporting,PMBOK 7,185,"This standard dedicates a domain to Measurement Performance Domain (2.7), which addresses activities associated with assessing project performance and implementing appropriate responses. Measures are used for evaluating performance compared to plan, demonstrating accountability, and tracking resource utilization. This includes establishing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) (2.7.1.1), tracking metrics such as Cost/Schedule Variance (CV/SV), and quantitative forecasts like Estimate at Completion (EAC) (2.7.2.7). Reports (4.6.7) are formal records or summaries of information."
17. Performance Measurement & Reporting,PRINCE2,205,"The Progress Practice (11) establishes mechanisms to monitor and compare actual achievements against those planned and provides a forecast for the project’s viability. This involves monitoring performance targets and escalating exceptions. PRINCE2 relies on specific management reports, including Highlight Reports (A.6), Checkpoint Reports (A.2), and End Stage Reports (A.4). Progress measurement often uses techniques like burn charts (11.3.2.5), which track work completed or remaining."
17. Performance Measurement & Reporting,ISO 21500,14,"This standard emphasizes on making progress clearer through consistent reporting, decision gates and escalation procedures"
17. Performance Measurement & Reporting,ISO 21502,50,"Reporting (7.15) is a specific practice that includes reporting on Progress (7.15.2), status (7.15.3), and performance against baselines to the appropriate management level. The project plan itself should be monitored (7.2.3) by continually checking actual performance against baselines for scope, quality, schedule, costs, and risks. Monitoring benefits (7.3.3) involves collecting performance measurements for each benefit."
18. Project Life Cycle & Development Approach,PMBOK 7,125,"This standard explicitly defines the Development Approach and Life Cycle Performance Domain (2.3) and addresses how the product, service, or result will be created and evolved during the project life cycle. Development approaches include predictive, iterative, incremental, adaptive, or hybrid methods. The life cycle can be broken into defined Project Phases (e.g., Feasibility, Design, Deploy, Close). These phases often culminate in a phase gate review (also known as stage gate) to check that the desired outcomes or exit criteria have been achieved before proceeding. The approach selected should be deliberately Tailored based on context."
18. Project Life Cycle & Development Approach,PRINCE2,122,"The method requires adherence to the principle to Manage by stages (2.6). A project life cycle is divided into mandatory stages (the initiation stage and at least one subsequent delivery stage). Towards the end of each stage, the project manager requests permission to proceed to the next stage. The purpose of dividing the project into stages is to enable the project board to confirm continued business justification. The delivery method can be linear-sequential, iterative-incremental, or hybrid, which involves determining the length of releases or timeboxes and defining these as stages."
18. Project Life Cycle & Development Approach,ISO 21500,13,"Project management relies on an integrated governance approach (4.6), which ensures work should be appropriately planned and actively managed [4.6]. The overall conceptual context recognizes that project success is achieved through delivering outputs (3.8) that lead to a beneficial outcome (3.7) and subsequent value realization over the project's life cycle."
18. Project Life Cycle & Development Approach,ISO 21502,17,"The standard addresses the Project life cycle (4.4), noting that the number and names of a project’s phases depend upon the delivery approach (e.g., predictive, iterative, incremental, adaptive, or hybrid). Decision points, often referred to as “gates,” are essential aspects of project governance and should precede each phase. The integrated practice of Managing the start and close of each project phase (6.6.4) is used to authorize the continuation of the project based on progressive justification."
