Custom Software Development Project
Approach: Lightweight Hybrid (Focus on Speed and Flexibility)
Stage 1: Initiation (Rapid Foundation)

Approximate Duration: 2–3 Weeks

1. Appoint Core Roles and Define Governance

Key Activities:
Identify and assign core roles such as the Project Manager, Senior User, and Supplier Representative. Establish clear accountability and decision-making responsibilities.

Justification:
Maintaining minimal layers and clearly defined roles ensures faster communication and decision-making — vital for smaller, fast-moving software teams. This aligns with the PRINCE2 principle of defining roles, responsibilities, and relationships.

Standards Reference:

PRINCE2: Sections 2.3, 6.2.1 (Pages 93, 43)

2. Formalize Initial Justification and Feasibility

Key Activities:
Develop an Outline Business Case and a Project Brief to confirm early feasibility and purpose.

Justification:
Verifying the project’s worth before full execution ensures continued business justification. A strong foundation of requirements helps form an early outcome-focused baseline.

Standards Reference:

ISO 21502: Sections 6.5.4, 4.3.2 (Pages 29, 17)

3. Select Adaptive or Hybrid Approach

Key Activities:
Define the Project Product Description, outlining user expectations and acceptance criteria. Choose an appropriate adaptive or hybrid delivery model.

Justification:
Tailoring the project approach enhances success probability. Adaptive approaches capitalize on smaller teams and iterative delivery cycles to maximize speed and responsiveness.

Standards Reference:

PMBOK 7: Sections G2.3.3, S3.7 (Pages 76, 46)

Stage 2: Planning (Focused and Progressive)

Approximate Duration: 4–5 Weeks

1. Progressive Scope Refinement

Key Activities:
Build a Product Backlog and create User Stories derived from defined requirements, refining scope progressively.

Justification:
Adaptive planning provides flexibility by detailing work just-in-time, avoiding lengthy upfront specifications. The plan evolves throughout the project lifecycle to remain responsive.

Standards Reference:

ISO 21502: Sections 7.2.2, 7.4.2 (Pages 36, 38)

2. Define Delivery Cadence

Key Activities:
Establish fixed iteration cycles or timeboxes (e.g., two-week sprints).

Justification:
Timeboxing enforces speed and ensures project timelines stay within shorter delivery windows (usually under six months). This promotes consistent delivery of incremental software value.

Standards Reference:

PRINCE2: Section 8.4.3.2 (Page 160)

3. Define Quality Thresholds

Key Activities:
Create a Definition of Done (DoD) and Quality Specifications for each deliverable.

Justification:
The DoD establishes clear acceptance criteria, ensuring quality is built into processes and deliverables — an essential PMBOK principle for continuous quality assurance.

Standards Reference:

PMBOK 7: Sections S3.8, G2.6.3 (Pages 79, 180)

4. Finalize Project Initiation Documentation (PID)

Key Activities:
Establish time, cost, and scope baselines within a lightweight Project Initiation Document (PID).

Justification:
The PID functions as a “contract” between the Project Manager and Project Board, maintaining governance while applying streamlined baselines suitable for hybrid projects.

Standards Reference:

PRINCE2: Sections 15.4.6, A12 (Pages 265, 318)

Stage 3: Execution (Iterative Delivery)

Approximate Duration: 10–12 Weeks (Integrated Iterations)

1. Execute Time-boxed Work Packages or Sprints

Key Activities:
Carry out development, testing, and integration within short, iterative sprints, delivering working increments frequently.

Justification:
Focuses on value delivery through iterative progress, producing usable outputs that support intended business outcomes.

Standards Reference:

PMBOK 7: Section 2.5 (Page 162)

2. Apply Manage by Exception

Key Activities:
Fix time and cost constraints, allowing controlled flexibility in scope or features.

Justification:
This PRINCE2 principle empowers the Project Manager to adapt quickly to deviations while maintaining momentum within agreed tolerances — crucial for short timelines.

Standards Reference:

PRINCE2: Section 2.4 (Page 44)

3. Continuous Quality Control

Key Activities:
Perform ongoing validation and verification throughout development to ensure deliverables meet acceptance criteria.

Justification:
Integrating quality control throughout the process increases the probability of producing outputs that are “fit for purpose.”

Standards Reference:

ISO 21502: Section 7.11.4 (Page 46)

Stage 4: Monitoring and Control (Lightweight and Visual)

Duration: Continuous

1. Visualize Progress and Performance

Key Activities:
Use visual management tools such as Kanban Boards, Task Boards, or Checkpoint Reports.

Justification:
These tools provide transparent and timely project tracking, allowing small agile teams to monitor progress efficiently without relying on heavy reporting structures.

Standards Reference:

PMBOK 7: Section G4.6.6 (Page 281)

2. Manage Issues and Change Control

Key Activities:
Maintain a Change Log and handle off-specifications through a formalized Change Control Process.

Justification:
Even in agile projects, structured change control ensures deviations are documented and approved, protecting the project’s baseline while recognizing the flexibility of software work.

Standards Reference:

PRINCE2: Section 10.2 (Page 188)

ISO 21502: Section 7.10 (Page 44)

3. Integrate Feedback and Adapt

Key Activities:
Conduct Iteration Reviews and Retrospectives to capture lessons and make continuous improvements.

Justification:
Frequent feedback cycles foster adaptability and resilience. Immediate learning enables corrective action and enhances team performance over successive iterations.

Standards Reference:

PMBOK 7: Sections S3.11, G2.5.8 (Pages 86, 170)

Stage 5: Closure (Formal Finalization)

Approximate Duration: 1 Week

1. Final Validation and Acceptance

Key Activities:
Verify that all deliverables meet their acceptance criteria and obtain formal Product Acceptance confirmation.

Justification:
Formal closure ensures all project objectives and deliverables are achieved, confirming scope completion.

Standards Reference:

ISO 21502: Section 6.8 (Page 33)

PRINCE2: Section 19.4 (Page 299)

2. Capture and Disseminate Lessons Learned

Key Activities:
Compile a Lessons Report documenting key takeaways, best practices, and improvement areas.

Justification:
Learning from experience is a core PRINCE2 principle. Capturing lessons promotes ongoing improvement across future software development initiatives.

Standards Reference:

ISO 21502: Section 7.18 (Page 52)
