ISO 21502: Section 6.6.4 (Page 31)

Stage 3: Execution (P3 – Staged Delivery)

Duration: Integrated over 2 Years

1. Managed Delivery in Stages/Work Packages

Key Activities:
The Project Manager delegates work through Work Packages to team leads, managing progress in controlled stages.

Justification:
Dividing the long project duration into stages ensures control, accountability, and structured delivery.

Standards Reference:

PRINCE2: Sections 16.4.1, 17, 2.5 (Pages 273, 280, 46)

2. Contract Administration and Quality

Key Activities:

Justification:
Managing supplier contracts and embedding quality into processes ensures value and compliance.

Standards Reference:

PMBOK 7: Sections G2.5.6, S3.8 (Page 79)

ISO 21502: Section 7.11 (Page 44)

3. Status Reporting
